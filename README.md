Analysis of UK Rail Delay Compensation Claims
This project explores patterns and inequalities in delay compensation claims across the UK rail network using a composite visualisation.  
The visualisation addresses how claims vary over time, differ between train operators, and relate to claim processing efficiency.  
Key findings highlight substantial inequality across operators, post-pandemic growth in claims, and a weak relationship between claim volume and processing efficiency.

The composite visualisation was created using R (ggplot2) based on data from the Office of Rail and Road.
